# g_game
A Guessing game written in Rust (for learning purposes).

## Running the Game

To run the game locally, you need to install the Rust language along with it's package manager, Cargo.

` $ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh `

Once you have Rust and Cargo installed, clone this repo and go to the root of the *g_game* directory.

 ` cd g_game `

Now, run the following command and play right in the terminal:

` cargo run `

**Have Fun! Cheers!**
